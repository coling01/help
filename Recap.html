  Important to understand that there are "browser
  app / website / webpage" that are run inside safari.
  And "apps" that are installed on phone or laptop
</div>
<div>
  To allow the most flexibility, lots of "apps" have <b>both</b> an app that is installed and a web
  page that offers similar functonality.
</div>
<div>
  i.e. Trickster oh-hell has an app that you use on your iphone, but also a website that Al uses on
  his laptop.
  ( Al cannot install apple iphone applications on windows laptop )

<h1>Browser "websites"</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    A browser is an app that is installed on phone ( such as Safari .. with the compass icon )
    or on laptop ( such as Chrome .. with the green /red /yellow swirl icon )

  <li>
    The browser points to "websites" on the internet. Such as bbc website, or news websites.
    <div>
      A "link" usually shows with an underline and takes you to a webpage. Though a link could also be a picture or icon.
